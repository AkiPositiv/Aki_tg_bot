The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a Telegram RPG bot project from scratch, following a detailed Russian-language technical specification. Initially, the engineer sought clarifications on core gameplay priority, deployment, database, authentication, and testing, aligning with the user's preferences for all functions, local SQLite, Telegram ID authentication, and manual testing.

The development proceeded in phases:
1.  **Foundation (V1.0)**: Setup of aiogram, SQLAlchemy with SQLite, core bot initialization, user registration, and profile management. Dependencies were carefully managed and installed.
2.  **Economy & Basic Combat (V2.0)**: Integrated comprehensive item, shop, and inventory systems. Basic PvP and training battles with initial damage formulas were implemented, alongside character progression and stat management.
3.  **Advanced Combat & Wars (V3.0 In Progress)**: The engineer began implementing interactive PvE battles and the complex Kingdom Wars system, including scheduling and initial stat-based calculations.

A critical turning point was the user's detailed feedback on combat mechanics (interactive turns, special hits/dodges, timed actions) and elaborate Kingdom War rules (scheduling, pre-war states, multi-kingdom attack logic, dynamic buffs, intricate reward/penalty distribution, and reporting). The AI engineer performed a self-assessment, identifying a 30% gap in meeting these detailed requirements. The user explicitly requested to complete these remaining functionalities. The engineer is currently focused on enhancing the battle and kingdom war services and handlers to meet these precise specifications, demonstrating a systematic approach to complex feature implementation.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a multi-user Telegram RPG bot featuring PvP and PvE combat. The game will be text-based with a classless character progression system, emphasizing stat development. Key features include:

1.  **Character Management**: Creation (name, gender, kingdom), profile viewing, level progression, experience system, and distribution of free stat points.
2.  **Economy & Inventory**: Money and premium currency (stones), a shop for buying/selling items (weapons, armor, consumables, materials, scrolls), and an inventory system for item management and equipping.
3.  **Combat Systems**:
    *   **PvP (Player vs. Player)**: Challenges, automated battle resolution, and interactive turn-based combat with attack/dodge choices, timers, critical hit/dodge mechanics (Glancing Hit, Perfect Dodge).
    *   **PvE (Player vs. Environment)**: Interactive battles against monsters with detailed monster cards, Fight and Flee options (flee chance based on agility, penalty for failure), and similar interactive turn-based combat with timed rounds and attack/dodge choices.
4.  **Dungeons**: PvE group content with waves of monsters, boss encounters, and loot distribution.
5.  **Skills**: Learning skills (from scrolls, other players), skill application in combat (auto-usage with mana/cooldown).
6.  **Global Events**:
    *   **Kingdom Wars**: Scheduled battles (3 times/day) between kingdoms based on aggregated player stats. Features include pre-war announcements, player activity blocking during participation, defender buffs (+30% Armor/HP if attacked by multiple kingdoms), sequential attacks from weakest to strongest, and full HP/Mana restoration for defenders after each wave.
    *   **Rewards/Penalties**: Complex system for distributing money/experience based on battle outcomes, including penalties for losing attackers and unparticipating defenders.
    *   **Reporting**: Global war reports in a War Channel and personal  reports.
7.  **Technical Backbone**: Python 3.11+, aiogram 3.x, SQLite (initial, migrating to PostgreSQL), SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, APScheduler. Authentication is via Telegram ID. Initial deployment on a local machine, moving to a server. Manual testing initially, supplemented by automated tests.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **aiogram 3.x**: Asynchronous framework for Telegram Bot API.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for Python, used with SQLite for database interactions.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management ().
- **APScheduler**: Task scheduling for recurring events like Kingdom Wars.
- **FSM (Finite State Machine)**: aiogram's state management for multi-step conversations (e.g., registration, dungeon entry).
- **Middlewares & Filters**: aiogram components for pre-processing updates (authentication, throttling) and routing logic.
- **Game Formulas**: Custom Python functions for core game mechanics (damage, XP, critical chance, dodge chance, rewards).
- **Interactive Combat**: Real-time decision-making for players in battles with timed turns.
- **Global Event Management**: Complex logic for scheduling, participating, and resolving large-scale kingdom vs. kingdom battles.

-   **Combat Formulas**: Refine all combat formulas, especially for critical hit/dodge variations (Glancing Hit, Perfect Dodge), to meet detailed specifications.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was actively working on enhancing the core battle and kingdom war systems to achieve 100% compliance with the user's highly detailed specifications from Chat Message 93.

The AI engineer performed an in-depth self-assessment (Chat Message 127) and identified that the current implementation covered approximately 70% of the new requirements. Upon the user's explicit instruction to Доработать недостающие 30% (fix the missing 30%), the engineer started creating enhanced versions of services and handlers.

The work involves:
-   **Skill System Integration**: A new  (or a significant modification) was created, indicating that the skill system's application in battle (e.g., auto-application as per user's request) is being developed or refined.
-   **Enhanced Battle Logic**:  is being developed to encapsulate the new, more complex combat mechanics for PvE, including precise attack options, refined flee mechanics, and advanced critical hit/dodge calculations (Glancing Hit, Perfect Dodge).
-   **Enhanced Kingdom War Logic**:  is being developed to handle the intricate rules for global kingdom wars, such as the multi-kingdom attack logic, dynamic defender buffs, and the complex reward/penalty distribution system.
-   **Enhanced Interactive Handlers**: New handlers  and  are being created to manage the interactive elements of both PvE and PvP combat, including the timed turns, player choices (attack type, dodge direction), and turn synchronization for PvP.
-   **Enhanced PvP Logic**:  is specifically for implementing the interactive PvP battle system, ensuring synchronization and detailed turn processing between two players.

The files mentioned as being successfully written in the last few messages (, , , , , ) directly reflect this ongoing work. The process is one of incremental refinement and addition of complex game mechanics on top of the existing foundation.
